# Issue: Combining Inline Button URL Link and Click Counting

## Goal

The request was to have the "Get Videos" button on the first message in the loop perform two actions simultaneously:
1.  Act as a deep link (`t.me/...`) to invite the bot to a group.
2.  Increment a click counter for the group in the database when clicked.

## Problem

Telegram's `InlineKeyboardButton` has mutually exclusive parameters for actions:
*   `url`: Makes the button open a standard web link or deep link. Clicking this navigates the user away immediately, and the bot receives **no notification** of the click.
*   `callback_data`: Sends a notification (CallbackQuery) back to the bot when clicked. The bot can then perform actions (like incrementing a counter). This button type does **not** open a URL directly.


## Attempted Workaround (`answerCallbackQuery` with URL)

A workaround was attempted using `callback_data` for the button and then trying to redirect the user using the `url` parameter within the `answerCallbackQuery` method in the handler.

Relevant Code:
*   **scheduler.py** (`_send_and_delete_message` function, around line 140): Sets up the button with `callback_data="get_videos_click_{group_id}"`.
*   **handlers.py** (`handle_get_videos_click` function, around line 494): Tries to call `await query.answer(url=deep_link_url)`.

**Result:** This failed with a `Url_invalid` error. The `url` parameter in `answerCallbackQuery` is primarily designed for launching Telegram Mini Apps (WebApps), not for standard `t.me` deep links.
